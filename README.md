# PyGame Utilities

A relatively small library of utilities I made to use when developing with the "PyGame" library. 
This library includes a plethora of ***highly*** customizable objects to be created and rendered in PyGame.  
These are the following:
- Button class: simple and customizable buttons 
- ScrollButton class: simple sliding buttons like volume or color sliders among other things
- TextButton class: text boxes to put it bluntly, with a couple of extra features
- Text class: an alternate method to render text in pygame (based on the same thing just a wrapper for it)
- Interface class: a console that can run in real time and be programmed with custom commands, very useful for testing and developing a complex game in PyGame

**Disclaimer**: Most if not all the documentation within the code (docstrings and comments) is in Portuguese.
